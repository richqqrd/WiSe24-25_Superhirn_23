"""guesser package for code-breaking implementations.

This package provides different guesser implementations for the Mastermind game:
    - IGuesser: Interface defining guesser behavior
    - PlayerGuesser: Human player implementation
    - ComputerGuesser: AI implementation using Knuth's algorithm
    
The guesser is responsible for making guesses to break the secret code
and processing feedback from those guesses."""
