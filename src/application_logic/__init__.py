"""application_logic package for game flow control.

This package manages the game flow and rules:
    - application_logic: Main implementation coordinating UI and game logic
    - i_application_logic: Interface defining core application logic behavior
    
The application logic layer:
    - Validates user input
    - Controls game flow
    - Coordinates between UI and game mechanics
    - Manages state transitions
    
Follows layered architecture with dependency injection for loose coupling."""
